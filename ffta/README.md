# Final Fantasy Tactics Advance MSU-1 pack

It was a MSU like any other. Music from FFTA for the Game Boy Advance.

Does not include tracks from the arrangement album. Apologies if you're
a fan of that.

Partial Extended MSU support - most dungeons have their own tune, with a
couple of repeats.

As with any MSU-1 pack, this should be compiled using
[msupcm++](https://github.com/qwertymodo/msupcm)
